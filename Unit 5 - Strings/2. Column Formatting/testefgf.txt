Sometimes, physics can be used to create beautiful art. Kinetic art is art that relies on motion to achieve a specific effect. Often that motion is just an application of simple laws of physics. Waves and harmonic motion (some examples include pendulums and springs) are often great sources of inspiration for creating mesmerizing displays.
