All that left to do is decide on the dimensions of your pendulum wave machine. For example, if I wanted to make the machine above, I'd place each pendulum above 5 cm apart, making the entire machine at least 70 cm long and 34.3 cm tall. However, one thing to note is that these pendulum wave demonstrations are made perfect by careful timing of the periods on each pendulum, not by careful measurement of the pendulum lengths. As such, make the individual pendulums on your machine adjustable! The very first design of this demonstration used 15 adjustable screws to which each pendulum tied on to. By carefully adjusting each screw and timing each pendulum, the correct number of oscillations can be tuned for each individual pendulum.
